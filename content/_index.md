# About Me
Hi! 
I am a final year Undergraduate Student at **Duke University** double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in German. I'm **applying to PhD programs** during the Fall 2024 cycle. 

My research interests inlcude adversarial machine learning, developing more secure large models, and applying ML methods in different fields. I have the privilege of working with [Professor Neil Gong](https://ece.duke.edu/people/neil-gong/) on a benchmark study comparing passive and watermarking methods on detecting AI-generated images. 

Additionally, I was fortunate to have worked with [Professor Tingjun Chen](https://tingjunchen.com) in developing an open-source pipeline for generating high-quality signal strength maps based on geographic data for mobile communication systems.
