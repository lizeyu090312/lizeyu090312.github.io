# About Me
Hi! 

I am a final year Undergraduate Student at **Duke University** double majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in German. I'm **applying to PhD programs** during the Fall 2024 cycle and look plan to starting my PhD journey in Fall 2025. 

My research interests inlcude adversarial machine learning and developing more secure large models. I have the privilege of working with [Professor Neil Gong](https://ece.duke.edu/people/neil-gong/) on a benchmark study comparing passive and watermarking methods on detecting AI-generated images. 

Additionally, I was fortunate to work with [Professor Tingjun Chen](https://tingjunchen.com) in developing an open-source pipeline for generating high-quality signal strength maps based on geographic data for mobile communications. 

<!-- I am a 1st year Computer Science Ph.D. student at **Duke University** advised by [Professor Matthew Lentz](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~mlentz/). My research interests include operating systems and security. -->

<!-- During my undergraduate degree at **Columbia University**, I had the privilege of working with [Professor Jason Nieh](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/) to extend the Linux Integrity Measurement Architecture IMA to containers without requiring changes to the kernel using eBPF.  -->

<!-- Additionally, I had the opportunity to work [Professor Hod Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/) in the Creative Machines Lab to design and build software for a 3D food printer. -->
